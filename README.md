# The Mattermost manager

## Introduction
Running a Mattermost server for years requires management on your self-hosted Mattermost instance.
Most important is keeping up to date with the lastest version without a lot of hassle.

So the mattermost_updater script is one to update to the lastest version of Mattermost or to the latest ESR version.
It will allow you to update to an Extended Supported Release or to the lastest and greatest. 

Features of the tool are:
* Automatic lookups for the latest versions
* Backup of mattermost folder before upgrade
* Preservation of custom plugins.


PLans for the future
* Create an installer for a new mattermost instance.
* Create cleaning and management tooling.
